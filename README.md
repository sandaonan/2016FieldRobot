2016Field Robot Race
=======


Inspire the creativity and design a robot which have can move in autonomous mode. Avoid any obstacles and doing many work in high accuracy.

Navigation
-------
The drive paths of the robots shall be between the crop rows and not above rows. Large robots or robots which probably partly damage the field or plants will always start after the other robots, including the second chance starting robots. However, damaged plants will be replaced by spare ones, to always ensure the same operation conditions for each run.

Autonomous Mode
-----
All robots must act autonomously in all tasks, including the freestyle. Driving by any remote controller during the task is not allowed at any time. This includes steering, motion and all features that produce movement or action at the machine.

Work
-----
Many works should be done during the contest. For example, grab the crop plants from one place to the another, water the plants in high accuracy, walk through a long curved floor, etc. These works should be done and can't bump into any other obstacles around the robot.
